 Excellent! The frontend has reloaded with the changes.

  ✅ Complete Implementation

  I've successfully implemented all four transformation buttons with the two-column layout you requested:

  🎯 New Layout Features:

  1. Two-Column Design: Original text (left) and ρ-space analysis (right)
  2. Original Text Preservation: Your text is always visible in a golden-bordered box
  3. Text Statistics: Character and word counts
  4. Wider Layout: Expanded to 1200px to accommodate both columns

  🚀 Four Working Transformation Buttons:

  1. 🎭 Transform the Style
    - Uses quantum steering to apply formal/academic attributes
    - Regenerates text with new style while preserving ρ-space essence
    - Shows before/after comparison
  2. 🌍→🪐 Un-Earthify This Text
    - Uses your new Un-Earthify system
    - Replaces Earth terms with consistent alien equivalents
    - Shows transformation details (e.g., "Earth → Pusiisem, NASA → Vexisam")
  3. 🔍 Explore Similar Passages
    - Searches Project Gutenberg based on extracted ρ-space attributes
    - Finds literature with similar narrative signatures
    - Shows thematic connections
  4. ⚡ Quantum Measurements
    - Applies POVM measurements to probe specific attributes
    - Shows detailed quantum analysis percentages
    - Demonstrates the measurement aspect of the theory

  🔬 Results Display:

  - Each transformation shows up in a new result box below the buttons
  - Results accumulate so you can compare multiple transformations
  - Each shows the transformation type, result text, and technical details

  Try it now! All four buttons should work and demonstrate different aspects of your ρ-space narrative theory - from style transformation to alien
  world-building, all while preserving the essential meaning captured in the quantum density matrix.
