Look,
discourse is the lens through [which] narratives are understood.
Hold that thought.
Let’s,
each Text instance that is repeated in the intellectual conscious mind ripples from the words into the meaning through the gate of discourse.

Hold that thought.
What I mean by discourse is a conversation (one-time or ongoing) between a specific subject, and subject characters that a person understands they are interacting with.
Simply put, hold that thought.
Over a lifetime. Hold that thought.

"Subject Character" is a notion I find myself forced to distinguish to specifically situate the poles of a discourse. If the basic model of a discourse is a person's conversation with some other Keep that in mind.
Then the context of the current communication is the discourse embodied by the person's memory of the past communications with that same other. We’ll come back to this. Look, to look closer at what the communication has, let's separate the reading (and hearing) from the writing (and speaking). Look, first, at the beginning of the communication, the "subject character" of the other will be identified that underlies the discourse that is implicitly presenting the meaning of the communication to the understanding of the person. We’ll come back to this. To tease this apart further, the discourse has not just of an intellectual model of this particular other person (or group of people Simply put, let’s, or some general category of many or all people in general) but also of the implicit relationship of the self of that person to the other end of the discourse. The idea of themselves that they live by (whether they are explicitly aware of this or not) is contained in each discourse as well as having a relation to some internal discourse, where this idea of themselves is creating and reading comments from itself Simply put, to itself as a means (if a misleading one) to consciously converse with themselves. In the internal discourse, it is meaningful to see that ones parents, friends, teachers, heroes, etc are the sources of the words that, in their absence Look, our mind supplies what we think they would say. Keep that in mind. Let’s, writing (and speaking) bring the discourse consciousness to mind as they choose an other subject character to address Simply put, and a subject matter that the person's own subject consciousness feels needs to be brought up with the audience. Keep that in mind. So, these two things come together. Keep that in mind. Okay, we think of something we want to say conjoined with thinking of who we want to say it to, along with the means we have to say it. What I mean is, before telephones existed, I would not think of calling someone to ask if they were busy that evening for dinner. Simply put, let’s, i would rather, with a similar thought, walk to their house and ask them in person. You can probably feel where this is going. Today, I may think of a FaceBook status I want to post, and would pick one that would be appropriate, maybe funny, maybe enlightening to many different friends and acquaintances of mine on FaceBook, representing a huge number of distinct yet related ongoing discourses. To back up a little bit, and seeing a language consciousness swimming in a sea of discourses each of that is changed by each communication related to the discourse You can probably feel where this is going. and further discourses that you didn't think were going to receive a specific communication may get it anyway. (for example, I may be keeping something secret from some people, so my discourse with them includes knowing that they do not know something that I do. Keep that in mind. If I later find out that they did know that thing, I would have to re-evaluate all of the communication I remembered Keep that in mind. and reassess the discourse retroactively to where I think I knew what they knew. Hold that thought. Let’s, in this way, the discourse becomes the way in that the mind makes models of the world. We’ll come back to this. Okay, at least the social world. Keep that in mind. Right, the intellect grows into understanding language through an unfolding process of self-awareness, seen through layers of discourse between the discursive self and the specific and generalized others.
