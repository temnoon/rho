Discourse is the lens through which narratives are understood. Each Text instance which is repeated in the intellectual conscious mind ripples from the words into the meaning through the gate of discourse. What I mean by discourse is a conversation (one-time or ongoing) between a specific subject, and subject characters that a person understands they are interacting with, over a lifetime.

"Subject Character" is a notion I find myself forced to distinguish in order to specifically situate the poles of a discourse. If the basic model of a discourse is a person's conversation with some other, then the context of the current communication is the discourse embodied by the person's memory of the past communications with that same other. To look closer at what the communication consists of, let's separate the reading (and hearing) from the writing (and speaking). First, at the beginning of the communication, the "subject character" of the other will be identified, which underlies the discourse which is implicitly presenting the meaning of the communication to the understanding of the person.

To tease this apart further, the discourse consists not just of an intellectual model of this particular other person (or group of people, or some general category of many or all people in general) but also of the implicit relationship of the self of that person to the other end of the discourse. The idea of themselves which they live by (whether they are explicitly aware of this or not) is contained in each discourse, as well as having a relation to some internal discourse, where this idea of themselves is creating and reading comments from itself, to itself as a means (if a misleading one) to consciously converse with themselves. In the internal discourse, it is meaningful to see that ones parents, friends, teachers, heroes, etc are the sources of the words which, in their absence, our mind supplies what we think they would say.

Writing (and speaking) bring the discourse consciousness to mind as they choose an other subject character to address, and a subject matter which the person's own subject consciousness feels needs to be brought up with the audience. These two things come together. We think of something we want to say conjoined with thinking of who we want to say it to, along with the means we have to say it.

What I mean is, before telephones existed, I would not think of calling someone to ask if they were busy that evening for dinner. I would rather, with a similar thought, walk to their house and ask them in person. Today, I may think of a FaceBook status I want to post, and would pick one which would be appropriate, maybe funny, maybe enlightening, to many different friends and acquaintances of mine on FaceBook, representing a huge number of distinct yet related ongoing discourses.

To back up a little bit, and seeing a language consciousness swimming in a sea of discourses, each of which is changed by each communication related to the discourse, and further discourses which you didn't think were going to receive a specific communication may get it anyway. (for example, I may be keeping something secret from some people, so my discourse with them includes knowing that they do not know something which I do. If I later find out that they did know that thing, I would have to re-evaluate all of the communication I remembered, and reassess the discourse retroactively to where I think I knew what they knew.

In this way, the discourse becomes the way in which the mind makes models of the world. At least the social world. The intellect grows into understanding language through an unfolding process of self-awareness, seen through layers of discourse between the discursive self and the specific and generalized others.
