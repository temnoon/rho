The hare bragged he could outrun anyone, especially the tortoise. The animals set a race.
The hare sprinted fast, then dozed in the sun. The tortoise kept a steady pace and passed him.
When the hare woke, he dashed to the finish, but the tortoise had already crossed the line.
The crowd cheered the slow, steady winner.
